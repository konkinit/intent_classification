## General Context

The identification of both Dialog Acts (DA) and Emotion/Sentiment (E/S) in spoken language is an important step toward
improving model performances on spontaneous dialogue task. Especially, it is essential to avoid the generic response
problem, i.e., having an automatic dialog system generate an unspecific response â€” that can be an answer to a very large
number of user utterances. DAs and emotions are identified through sequence labeling systems that are trained in a
supervised manner DAs and emotions have been particularly useful for training ChatGPT.

## Problem Statement:

We start by formally defining the Sequence Labelling Problem. At the highest level, we have a set $D$ of conversations
composed of utterances, i.e., $D = (C_1,C_2,\dots,C_{|D|})$ with $Y= (Y_1,Y_2,\dots,Y_{|D|})$ being the corresponding
set of labels (e.g., DA,E/S). At a lower level each conversation $C_i$ is composed of utterances $u$, i.e $C_i= (
u_1,u_2,\dots,u_{|C_i|})$ with $Y_i = (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_{|C_i|})$ being the corresponding sequence of labels: each
$u_i$ is associated with a unique label $y_i$. At the lowest level, each utterance $u_i$ can be seen as a sequence of
words, i.e $u_i = (\omega^i_1, \omega^i_2, \dots, \omega^i_{|u_i|})$.

The goal is to predict Y from D !
